# i3 Dotfiles

Dotfiles will include:
 - i3 Config
     - including lock.sh
 - Polybar Config
     - including Setup.sh

### Note: Prior to Install
It is preferred that prior to running the installation script the user installs a fresh version of Arch or Manjaro with Gnome as the starting DE. Once this has been carried out the rest of the cloning and installation can take place. The other required packages (listed below) for this set of dotfiles will be installed by the install.sh.
